üìä Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)
üìñ Project Overview

This project presents a Power BI dashboard built to analyze and optimize supply chain operations. The dashboard provides insights into revenue, costs, supplier performance, product demand, inventory levels, and transportation efficiency. By combining multiple perspectives into one interactive report, it helps decision-makers identify trends, measure performance, and take data-driven actions.

The report is structured into three main dashboards: Overview, Product Insight, and Supplier Insight. Each section focuses on a different dimension of the supply chain, providing both high-level summaries and detailed breakdowns.

üìä Dashboard Previews

1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview Dashboard

The Overview dashboard provides a high-level summary of supply chain performance. It highlights total revenue, costs, stock levels, and the number of products sold. Revenue is analyzed across customer demographics, product types, and shipping carriers to reveal the most profitable segments. Supplier performance is compared using average profit margins, while SKU-level revenue insights identify the best-performing products. This page serves as the starting point for understanding the overall health of the supply chain.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Product Insight Dashboard

The Product Insight dashboard focuses on understanding product performance and inventory management. It tracks order quantities and stock levels across SKUs, ensuring that demand and supply are balanced. Lead times are compared against manufacturing lead times, which highlights efficiency gaps and opportunities for process improvement. Additionally, this dashboard evaluates average profit margins by product type, helping to identify which categories, such as skincare, haircare, or cosmetics, deliver the strongest financial returns.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Supplier Insight Dashboard

The Supplier Insight dashboard evaluates supplier performance and transportation efficiency. It analyzes the distribution of costs across transportation modes such as road, rail, air, and sea. Alongside this, defect rates are monitored for each mode, offering visibility into quality and reliability. Supplier-level analysis includes comparisons of costs, shipping contributions, manufacturing output, and stock levels. This enables businesses to assess supplier reliability, negotiate better contracts, and optimize their logistics strategies.

üìÇ Files in Repository

This repository contains the main Power BI file (SupplyChain_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix), a collection of dashboard screenshots stored in the Images/ folder, and optionally, the dataset if it is not confidential. These resources make it easy for others to explore and understand the analysis without requiring direct access to the raw data.

üõ† Tools and Technologies

The dashboard was developed using Power BI Desktop, with data sourced from Excel/CSV files. Data transformations were performed using Power Query and calculations were implemented in DAX to create measures, KPIs, and time intelligence functions.

üöÄ How to Use

To explore the dashboard, download the .pbix file from this repository and open it using Power BI Desktop. The interactive features such as slicers and filters allow you to navigate through the report and analyze the data in detail.

üìà Key Insights

The analysis reveals that the supply chain generated a total revenue of $578K from more than 46,000 products sold. Skincare products emerged as the top-performing category with revenues of $0.24M, while Carrier B contributed the most to shipping-related revenue at $0.25M. Supplier 1 provided the highest stock availability of over 1,100 units and also delivered the strongest profit margin at 22.72%. On the cost side, road transportation accounted for the highest share at 30.32%, while defect rates varied across other transportation modes.
